Witnessed linux being installed from (many) floppy discs (using GNU/Linux since
the SLS days). I turned to Archlinux since then, not without testing every
possible distro out there, with many dating from Pleistocene and now extinct.

Ruby lover (I often use Padrino, Ramaze, Sinatra and soon Volt.rb), I also can
play happily with perl, shell, python, and produce some C/C++ patches. I even
can do some js or php when someone points a gun at me. Note that no gun,
whatever it's size, will make me code some lisp or prolog again.

I had much fun working with digital electronics to build anything from museum
oriented devices to electronic RFID cat doors (so we don't host cat "free
parties" in our basement).

Deep knowledge of the TCP/IP stack: my next goal is to decode Ethernet frames up
to the application level just looking at an hexadecimal frame dump (I won't
decode SSL though). While I can talk CatOS or IOS (the one from Cisco), I really
love iptables/iproute2.

Worked extensively with various major web serving software (squid, apache,
nginx, varnish, haproxy), sometimes in clustering or cloudified situations. I
also _love_ Cyrus, Redis, Mysql/Percona/MariaDB and have good vibrations with
postfix.

Since I'm as lazy as a sysadmin can be, I have been focusing on Ansible starting
in it's early days, writing deployment playbooks to blossom bare metal machines
(or instances) into fully featured flowery clusters, and currently playing with Docker & Consul.

I am pretty sold to CI/CD, microservices and MonitorAllTheThings™, and
often discuss about that whith my rubberdyno.

I am open to freelance DevOps-oriented opportunitites on webstacks
architecture, operations, monitoring, infrastructure and software
delivery automation.
