In the [previous]({% post_url 2015-03-15-testing-ansible-roles-part-2 %}) post, wrote a basic `test` file.

We will now improve it a bit and test other RoleSpec assertions.

## Adding other tests

## Ansible version

In the [next part]({% post_url 2015-03-17-testing-ansible-roles-part-4 %}), we will add TravisCI support, so we can test our role when it is pushed on GitHub.
